## Problem Definition and Analysis

The project at hand addresses the vital task of automatic facial expression detection, situated at the crossroads of computer vision, machine learning, and behavioral sciences. This undertaking involves the intricate analysis of facial images to decipher the emotional states conveyed by individuals portrayed in those images. The primary objectives of this project can be outlined as follows:

High-Level Emotion Classification: The foremost goal is to categorize facial images into three broad emotional categories: "Positive," "Negative," or "Surprised." This challenging task necessitates the training of a machine learning model capable of not only recognizing but also differentiating between these distinct emotional states.

FACS Code Detection: The second objective is the identification of specific facial actions or expressions denoted by Facial Action Coding System (FACS) codes. Each FACS code corresponds to a particular facial movement or expression. This task, however, is binary in nature. It involves determining whether a particular FACS code is present (indicated by "yes" or 1) or absent (indicated by "no" or 0).
